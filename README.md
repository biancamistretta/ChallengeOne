Description
This is the first project of the Columbia Bootcamp course. This is a site that a company named Horseon would use to promote their SEO best practices. The assignment was to make the page more accessible. 

Installation
N/A

Usage
On this site, many accessibility elements were implemented. Font and background color complement each other. All photos include an alt text. Lastly, the HTML code was changed to be simpler and use semantics. 

Credits
The website's index and CSS were already written, I just changed elements to make the site more accessible. For exmaple, I removed many <div> elements and added a header and section elements. I also changed the colors of the font and background so that they have a better contrast. I lastly changed the SEO class to black so that the logo is easier to see to the user.
